Commands that transform the model.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
All commands transform the model but this package is contains commands that aren't covered by the other packages. 
</p>
<p>
When creating new transformations, try to reuse existing code; make CompoundCommands that use others instead of recoding everything. You may not be aware of all the issues surrounding changing a certain PathNode type.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, don't look at commands that are a hybrid of CompoundCommand and Command as examples. Look for clean ones. Hybrid commands are ugly and hard to maintain; if you find one, make sure there's a bug to refactor it in BugZilla.
